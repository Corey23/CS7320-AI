    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different reflex-based agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n",

    "__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n",

    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actuators:__ The agent can clean the current square (action `suck`) or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",

    "## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n",

    "1. Make sure that you use the latest version of this notebook. Sync your forked repository and pull the latest revision. \n",
    "2. Your implementation can use libraries like math, numpy, scipy, but not libraries that implement inteligent agents or complete search algorithms. Try to keep the code simple! In this course, we want to learn about the algorithms and we often do not need to use object-oriented design.\n",
    "3. You notebook needs to be formated professionally. \n",
    "    - Add additional markdown blocks for your description, comments in the code, add tables and use mathplotlib to produce charts where appropriate\n",
    "    - Do not show debugging output or include an excessive amount of output.\n",
    "    - Check that your PDF file is readable. For example, long lines are cut off in the PDF file. You don't have control over page breaks, so do not worry about these.\n",
    "4. Document your code. Add a short discussion of how your implementation works and your design choices.\n",

    "The simple environment above is not very realistic. Your environment simulator needs to follow the PEAS description from above. It needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize the environment by storing the state of each square (clean/dirty) and making some dirty. ([Help with random numbers and arrays in Python](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS7320-AI/blob/master/Python_Code_Examples/random_numbers_and_arrays.ipynb))\n",
    "* Keep track of the agent's position.\n",
    "* Call the agent function repeatedly and provide the agent function with the sensor inputs.  \n",
    "* React to the agent's actions. E.g, by removing dirt from a square or moving the agent around unless there is a wall in the way.\n",
    "* Keep track of the performance measure. That is, track the agent's actions until all dirty squares are clean and count the number of actions it takes the agent to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest implementation for the environment is to hold an 2-dimensional array to represent if squares are clean or dirty and to call the agent function in a loop until all squares are clean or a predefined number of steps have been reached (i.e., the robot runs out of energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation environment should be a function like the `simple_environment()` and needs to work with the simple randomized agent program from above. **Use the same environmnt for all your agent implementations in the tasks below.**\n",

The enviornment is also created using the random choice function. Weights were added to the function make each square have a 20% chance of being labeled dirty (indicated by True when dirty and False when clean). Using the coordinates of the location for the agent will inform the agent of the percepts needed to govern the actions of the agent. Each action will update the percepts and add 1 to the performance measure that indicates the number of steps taken. The number of dirty squares in the enviornment is held in the variable 'dirtySquares'.\n",

The 'max_steps' parameter limits the performance of the agent to a maximimum step size that ends the simulation if the room is not cleaned by the time the number of maximum steps is reached. In order to update the percepts there is a series of if-statements to inform the bumpers of there actual values."

    "Model-based agents use a state to keep track of what they have done and perceived so far. Your agent needs to find out where it is located and then keep track of its current location. You also need a set of rules based on the state and the percepts to make sure that the agent will clean the whole room. For example, the agent can move to a corner to determine its location and then it can navigate through the whole room and clean dirty squares.\n",

    "The model-based reflex agent allows for more control in movement than that of the simple reflex agent. Since this agent can maintain memory, th eagent can find ways to locate itself within the enviornment. Firstly, the agent is initialized with a name and two characterisitics. The first one is the initial direction the agent should go once it reaches the desired starting position. Second is the boolean 'findStart' that is set to True to indicate that the starting position hasn't been found yet.\n",

    "he ideal starting position is [0,0] in the enviornment array. Once we get to this point the agent will snake through the enviornment across each row from the east wall to the west wall and vice versa until the room is cleaned or the max_steps have been reached."

As it stands, an irregularly shaped room may never actually be cleaned due to the structure of the agent as it is while the other two agents will eventually reach every section of the room.\n",

An option would be to always move to the closest unchecked/uncleaned square (note that this is actualy depth-first search).\n",

For the implementation, we give the environment a 2-dimensional array of probabilities. The utility of a state is defined as the number of currebntly clean squares in the room. Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 100000 time steps. To do this, the agent needs to learn the probabilities with which different squares get dirty again. This is very tricky!"
